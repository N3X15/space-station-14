Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for /vg/station 14, a fork of [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.io). We have some differing gameplay elements and design philosophies, so our content does not mesh well with SS14 ("upstream").

This repository does not contain the engine, but a sort of "content pack" with our content.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.

## Documentation/Wiki

TODO

The upstream [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has documentation on SS14s content, engine, game design and more. We also have lots of resources for new contributors to the project.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody. Get in Discord if you want to help. We've got a [list of issues](https://github.com/vgstation-coders/space-station-14/issues) that need to be done and anybody can pick them up. Don't be afraid to ask for help either!

We are not currently accepting translations of the game on our main repository. If you would like to translate the game into another language consider creating a fork or contributing to a fork.
